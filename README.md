# BicycleGAN_simple
To train the model, run train.py. Remember to download edge to shoes dataset and unzip it in the folder of train.py. So the dataset of edge to shoes should be inside a folder called edges2shoes, which is located in the same folder as train.py. To perform inference run inference.py. No arguments need for both files.
